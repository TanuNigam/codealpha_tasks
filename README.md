📟 Web Calculator:
A fully functional web-based calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application supports real-time calculations with a clean user interface and responsive layout.

🚀 Features:
Basic arithmetic operations (+, −, ×, ÷, %)
Delete last character (DEL)
Clear entire input (C)
Supports decimal calculations
Error handling during invalid expressions
Responsive and visually clean UI

🛠️ Technologies Used:
Technology	Purpose
HTML	Structured the calculator layout, display screen, and buttons
CSS	Styled the UI using Flexbox for alignment and Grid for button layout
JavaScript	Implemented calculator logic (append(), calculate(), delChar(), clearScreen()) using DOM manipulation.

🔍 Challenges & Solutions:
Challenge	Solution
Display not updating dynamically	Used append() and DOM methods to manage real-time user input
Handling multiple operators or invalid inputs	Added validation & used try...catch in calculate()
Button alignment issues	Used CSS Grid layout with repeat(4, 1fr) and gap for spacing
UI not structured properly	Implemented Flexbox, box-shadow, and border-radius for clean UI
